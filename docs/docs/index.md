# Mosaic Plot

Mosaic Plot is a Grafana panel plugin for visualizing large datasets as heatmaps<br>
Mosaic Plot differs from existing heatmap panels by providing several additional [features](features.md) as well as by providing many more styling options

Besides visualizing regular heatmaps, Mosaic Plot can be used to plot regular timeseries data with high cardinalities in a very space-efficient manner<br>
Mosaic Plot can be configured to be very compact, allowing a user to show a very large amount of data while taking up only a minimum porition of a dashboard's "real estate"
